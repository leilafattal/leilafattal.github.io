# Hi, I'm Leila! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm 10 years old, and I love **photography**, **cats**, and **biology**. 🐱📸🔬 I'm also learning how to code and build websites, so you'll see me experimenting with all kinds of fun projects!

## A Little About Me:

- 🐾 I have the cutest cat ever (his name is Whiskers)!
- 📷 I love taking pictures of nature, especially animals and plants.
- 🔬 I'm super curious about biology and how living things work.
- 💻 I'm learning web coding and can't wait to share my creations with the world.

## What You'll Find Here:

- 🌟 Cool web experiments with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 📸 A photo gallery of my favorite pictures.
- 🔬 Fun biology facts and discoveries.
- 🐱 Maybe a page all about cats... because why not?!
